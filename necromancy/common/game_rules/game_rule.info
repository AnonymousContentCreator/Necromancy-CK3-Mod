Naturally, this content fits in better with CK2's Supernatural and Absurd content then it does
CK3's right now, as CK3 generally has less of the wackiness that CK2 had. For this content to be
added and mesh with CK3 I figured copying the way CK2 did it made sense, so I created a game rule that
corresponds to the one in CK2.

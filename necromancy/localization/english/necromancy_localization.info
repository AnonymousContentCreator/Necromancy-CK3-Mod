The design document said to ship this..:
"if it were a work
task you are handing over to Quality Assurance Testing for final approval prior to release in an official
Paradox Development Studio Grand Strategy game."

However, I am unsure at what stage Paradox handles localization in other languages!
IE; If localization is handled before QA, or if localization takes place after.
For now, going to assume that just including english localization is okay!

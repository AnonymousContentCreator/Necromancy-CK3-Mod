necromancy.0001.t: "A Dark Discovery"
necromancy.0001.desc: "During my research, I have found a curious inscription. It is hard to read, and looks as if it was scrawled by a mad man. But it seems  to show a series of rituals and rites that one can perform in order to imbue a soul into an ordinary amulet. Through such a rite many occult rituals are possible - the raising of the soulless body as a soldier, and the extension of our life, for starters.\nIs it right to go down such research? The realm will not look fondly on me for such an act.\nIt goes against the natural order of things, it's wrong.. Right?"
necromancy.0001.a: "Imagine the possibilities..."
necromancy.0001.a.tt:0 "[actor.GetFirstName] unlocks the #high $Dark Ritual$#! Execution Option, which [actor.GetSheHe] can use against a #high $King$#! or #high $Emperor$#! to create a truly sinister artifact."
necromancy.0001.b: "No, this isn't me. This isn't right!"
necromancy.0002.t: "A Sordid Ritual"
necromancy.0002.d: "With some effort, my guards have prepared [recipient.GetFirstName] for the ritual. If I was going to do this, it had to be right. I couldn't afford any mistakes, I couldn't afford to lose this opportunity!\n\nI recited the ritual, words from a soul I dare not name. My hand's shook, my mind spun in circles, and my heart skipped a beat. I did not know the meaning of the words I spoke, shaping twisted and horrid sounds. As I felt my sense of time fade, my body began to ache from the strange rituals I had done .\nIn the end, I was able to extract the soul of [recipient.GetFirstName].. It was such a wonderful experience - to hold the little wisp of their very essence in your hands. Complete, unfiltered control.\n\nIt felt amazing - it was amazing.\nI had to do it again!"
necromancy.0002.a: "Such power!"
necromancy.0003.t: "Raw Power!"
necromancy.0003.desc: "This #high power#!...\n\nI feel it grow with every soul I take. Every pest I crush, every little flicker of hope I pull from my their pale, worthless bodies.\nThis power is the key to the world. With it I could accomplish so much - I could live forever… Overthrow [actor.GetFaith.HighGodName] and claim [actor.GetFaith.DivineRealm||U] as my own personal kingdom! Who could stop me then!?\n\n#high I need this power!#!"
necromancy.0003.a: "My hunger grows, I need more!"
necromancy.0004.t: "Changing Demeanor"
necromancy.0004.desc: "Ever since I took up the dark arts my vassals have been telling me that I haven't been the quite the same.\nI don't know what they could be talking about. If anything, they are the odd ones for speaking out of turn!\n\nHow dare they insult their sovereign like that. I could have them beheaded for an insult like that.\n\nI'm not changing, they are."
necromancy.0004.a: "How dare they.."
necromancy.0005.t: "Our Liege Practices Dark Magic!"
necromancy.0005.desc: "#high \"Sorcery, witchcraft, necromancy - [evil_liege.GetSheHe] practices it all!\n[evil_liege.GetFirstName] must be the Scourge of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodName]!\"#!\n\nMany in our court have been gossiping about [evil_liege.GetFirstName], they seem to be expecting that we will do the right thing and stand up to [evil_liege.GetHerHim] on their behalf!"
necromancy.0005.a: "I will not accept an evil liege!"
necromancy.0005.b: "I-it can't be true.. Right...?"
char_interaction.0170.desc_soul_stolen:0 "The door slammed open, and [actor.GetShortUINamePossessive] guards forced me to the floor and pinned me down. Then the [actor.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] [actor.GetHerselfHimself] entered, in his hands some sort of strange, darkened and vile artifact.\n\nI wasn't sure at first what was happening - I knew it took hours, as the sun had fallen low and the moon had replaced her.. Yet it felt longer than that, much longer. Hours turned to days, days turned to months as I watched them dance and spiral in such strange shapes.\n\nI felt myself getting smaller, like the world was shrinking around me. My life.. It slowly stopped being of much mind to me. My life, all my accomplishments and dreams - whisked away into [actor.HisHer] palm.\n\nSoon, I would be nothing at all. [actor.GetName] taking away more than just my life, but my very essence - my soul!"
